## Introduction
  The overprescription of opioids has become a growing concern in the United States, with an estimated 2.1 million Americans struggling with opioid addiction. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, aiming to address the issue of overprescription. However, the effectiveness of these guidelines in reducing opioid prescriptions and opioid-related harm is yet to be fully understood. In this project, we will use machine learning models in R to analyze the impact of the 2016 CDC guidelines on opioid prescription rates and the associated harm. We will explore various factors that contribute to overprescription of opioids, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, and geographic location. Our goal is to provide insights into the effectiveness of the CDC guidelines and identify potential areas for improvement in opioid prescription practices.
  
Opioids provides a very effective treatment for chronic and acute pain, but they are also the cause of one of the biggest public health crisis in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around half a million deaths were caused by opioids overdose from 1999â€“2020, including prescribed and illegal opioids.
